14.669805526733398	However, there is the following difference.
14.678728103637695	For an algorithm key of length n bits, where  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is less or equal to 256, the n least significant bits of the 256 bits of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 output shall be used as the algorithm key.
14.722723960876465	The reason for choosing such a value is to avoid any possibility that the value may be used to derive the same  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 again.
14.728106498718262	The following values for organizations are assigned:
14.730372428894043	The reference model is the same as described in section 4.1.

16.705263137817383	indicates permission to do something
16.707651138305664	If this alternative is implemented, then there shall be a separate mechanism available for the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  to override the policy (for example to delete the stored temporary identifier, which would result in using the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1   _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 upon the next connection).
16.708547592163086	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 parameter is included to enable the bidding down protection of security features.
16.709192276000977	The interface to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1, and it need not be standardised as part of this architecture.

16.74287223815918	As part of the registration  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  executes primary authentication of the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  and then initiates the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0   _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 procedure, after the authentication is successful.
16.74555015563965	The serving network could be a shared network operated by two or more network operator.
16.74822425842285	If not, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 is rejected.
16.750600814819336	If the received  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  security policy is " Not needed ", then the establishment of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  Session shall proceed as described in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.

16.751346588134766	This follows the scheme for the generation of sequence numbers specified in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
16.752395629882812	If a temporary  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is sent to a client but then the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  does not initiate new authentication attempts for a long period of time, the key used for the generation of that temporary  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  could eventually be removed from all the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 servers.
16.752643585205078	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  decides, based on the subscription profile of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and the authenticated indication that authentication has been completed by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 , that authentication by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  is not required for the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4.

16.78252601623535	This yields to a number of features that inform the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 events, such as:
16.78261375427246	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  document, in the form of a questionnaire, which when completed for an implementation or system becomes an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
16.782678604125977	This can be a request to perform an Nudm service, or a Notification that the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  has previously subscribed to at the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  by means of a service the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  consumes from the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
16.78363037109375	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  checks the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 authentication parameters and responds to the authentication challenge.

17.533836364746094	The figure illustrates the following security domains:
17.534099578857422	The authenticator in the access network informs the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  about the successful authentication with the  _Grammar_effigy/Procedure_0  Success  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0.
17.534170150756836	If there is a specific  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  for an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  using a particular Ua protocol, and unless this  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  explicitly prohibits the use of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , the operator is allowed to configure a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  policy whether to accept 2G subscribers or not for this  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5.
17.53427505493164	For security and the prevention of damage to the network, the end  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  cannot directly modify the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 subscription profile data.
17.534961700439453	This annex (or a part of it) can be removed e.g. if  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  is updated in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  and a reference to the new  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 is added.
17.536725997924805	It follows from the preceding sentence in particular that access authentication for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  access in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  using  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 is not allowed.
17.536808013916016	This may correspond to an area in which the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 offers specific services.
17.537216186523438	It is also used by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  ( _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 ) that have previously subscribed, to get notified by means of the Notification service operation when  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 decides to modify the subscribed data.
17.537687301635742	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  registers to the same  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  via  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  access, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 can decide not to run a new authentication if it has an available security context to use.

17.53874397277832	If this happens, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  process shall be terminated as defined in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
17.538949966430664	One example of ensuring this is the deletion of the derived security context in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  server after the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0 has left active state.

17.720630645751953	Consequently, this results in an increase of the stored  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  Uplink  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  value in the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1  COUNT pair associated with the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 access.
17.72145652770996	If the two SPIs are different, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall assume that  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  has occurred, and the new  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  key shall be retrieved from the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 server.

17.789691925048828	The "short" sequence number forms the least significant bits of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  while the "long" sequence number forms the most significant bits of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
17.789796829223633	For this, the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  needs to store in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  memory the last inserted  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  to be able to compare that with the used  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  at  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 insertion and power up; or

17.795894622802734	It is also used by consumer NFs ( _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 ) to retrieve registration information from the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 by means of the Get service operation.
17.796253204345703	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  verifies that  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 is correct and hereby authenticates the network.
17.796533584594727	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  may ignore an  _Grammar_effigy/Procedure_0  Identity request or respond with the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 it sent in the Registration Request.
17.796632766723633	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  specified in this annex is called  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 .  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  allows access to applications in a more secure way than would be possible with the use of passwords or with  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 without enhancements.

17.850204467773438	The primary authentication and key agreement  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall bind the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 to the serving network.
17.850324630737305	If  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , or both  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  are to be used, this use has to be agreed between  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  prior to the execution of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  described in the remainder of this  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
17.851383209228516	At the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  side, in either case, the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  applies the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  cipher key  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 from the key set which was used before the intersystem handover.
17.85146713256836	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  decides to authenticate the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , it shall use one of the methods from  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
17.851661682128906	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  decides to authenticate the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0 , it shall use one of the methods from  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
17.85213851928711	The transmission of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  in the clear is permitted between  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  core network entities if it has the form of an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.852325439453125	The corresponding  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  value of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  is included in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  parameter of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.85317611694336	In the case that  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is used, a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  control session is established between the Trusted  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.854419708251953	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1(s) is out of the scope of the present document.
17.854705810546875	The key derivation  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 may be used with multiple NAFs during the lifetime of the key material.
17.85471534729004	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  does not receive any selection of integrity and ciphering algorithms, it continues to use the same algorithms as before the handover (see  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  or  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1  for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1).
17.855295181274414	Compatibility with the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  format defined in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  is achieved by choosing the temporary  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  tag such that the printable character equals the leading digit for the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  defined in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1.
17.8554744720459	The "additional scope" information indicates the resources and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  (service operations) that are allowed on these resources for the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 Service Consumer.
17.85576057434082	Strictly speaking, an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , and the derivation of an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  from an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  as in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0 ,  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1  are only defined in the context of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.85688018798828	The request contains the type of the requested information (/ _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ) and query parameters (supportedFeatures,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1).
17.856897354125977	If the control plane  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  for  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  parameters update is supported by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  shall store the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 after the completion of the primary authentication.
17.85753059387207	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  decides to release the offloaded connections to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and later decides to  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  the offloading to the same  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  Counter value shall keep increasing, thus keeping the computed  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5 fresh.
17.858074188232422	This term collectively refers to all  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  variants that make use of a form of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  protocol on the Ub interface, i.e. the term refers to  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 ,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , and 2G  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4 , as defined in the present document, and to  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  as defined in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0. <b> </b>
17.858219146728516	In roaming scenarios, there is an additional case where the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  server resides within the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 Proxy.
17.858749389648438	It is assumed that there is a trust relationship between the wireline operator that manages the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  operator managing the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2.
17.85917854309082	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  may determine according to its local policy that the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 shall not serve 2G subscribers.
17.859413146972656	After successful bootstrapping  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  shall store the key  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 , the nonce, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , and an indication of the underlying security quality, i.e.  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4 , for further use, until the key Ks is updated or until the deletion conditions in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0 are satisfied.
17.860183715820312	If no such indication is received by the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0 , and there is no  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  information in the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_2  shall consider the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1   _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 access as untrusted.
17.860687255859375	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  Service Consumer is not authorized, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  in the home  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  shall not issue an access token to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 Service Consumer.
17.86130714416504	General requirements for the functionality of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 are:
17.861942291259766	The lifetime of a Session  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is subject to local policies of the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
17.863765716552734	The possible  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  causes are either that the network signature was wrong or that the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 response was wrong;
17.86382293701172	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is used as freshness input into  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  derivations as described in the  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  and  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1 respectively, to mitigate the replay attack.
17.86403465270996	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  behaviour is the same regardless if the handover is  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , intra  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , Xn, or N2 with the exception that during  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  handover, the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  may retain the same key based on an indication from the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.864179611206055	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall derive the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  from  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and send it to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  which is used by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  to derive  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0 security keys.
17.86469841003418	An absence of the certificate from the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  if the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  had requested the certificate  or unsuccessful  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  confirmation shall result in a connection  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2.
17.86484146118164	When notifications are supported by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , it will include a reference to the general description of notifications support over the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  SBIs specified in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  /  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1.
17.865205764770508	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  did not indicate that it is willing to accept a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  based on  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 , or if the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  determines according to its local policy that the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  shall not serve subscribers using  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  Digest credentials, then the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6  shall not send a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_7  based on  _Grammar_effigy/Data_8;
17.866029739379883	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 Server initiates the authentication challenge.
17.866165161132812	Currently the following values have been defined:
17.86634635925293	Key generating function used to compute  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0
17.866899490356445	Setting up or not  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0   _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  calls: the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  should be able to control whether the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 sets up connections when ciphering is not enabled by the network;
17.8670597076416	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  server,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  shall behave as described in this paragraph irrespective of whether the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0   _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 address is already in use or not.
17.86741065979004	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  verifies the integrity of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  by comparing the received  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  with the generated  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.867494583129883	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0 uses the same subscription credential(s) for multiple registrations in the same or different serving networks.
17.867645263671875	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  extracts the serialized values from the components of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 object.
17.867645263671875	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0 's home  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  locates the bootstrapping information using the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 , processes the request (including possible requests for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , local policy check, etc.), derive the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  specific key, and send the response to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5.
17.86846351623535	This results in a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  chain, where the next  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  is always fresh and derived from the previous  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2.
17.868553161621094	These parameters are optional and if they are missing from subscriber's  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  or subscriber does not have  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  then the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  will use the default values in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  local policy defined by the particular  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4.
17.868789672851562	Any other types of parameters are not allowed in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0   _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
17.86890983581543	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  based authentication does not provide authentication of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  towards the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  Service Consumer or protection of the service request sent by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  Service Consumer to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4.
17.869014739990234	Call Forwarding on mobile subscriber Busy
17.86973762512207	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  e.g. in visited network indicates only the requested  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , but it is unaware of the grouping in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 of the subscriber.
17.870384216308594	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  service is also used by the subscribed consumer NFs (e.g.  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 ) to get notified by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  when a subscribed event occurs at the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 by means of the Notify service operation.
17.87055206298828	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  sends a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  request to the resource representing the individual  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 registration that is to be deregistered.
17.871551513671875	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall be disabled in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 in the deployments where support of unauthenticated emergency session is not a regulatory requirement.
17.871612548828125	This protection does not, however, cover the signalling data exchanged between RNCs over  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ; hence a separate requirement is needed for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
17.8717041015625	Generation   and use of the mapped security context in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0
17.872976303100586	If "singleNssai" is not included, and "dnn" is included,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall return all  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  configurations identified by "dnn" for all network slices where such  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 is available.
17.87310028076172	The DnaiChangeType data type shall comply with the provisions defined in table 5.4.3. _Grammar_effigy/Data_0.

17.87327003479004	In case of a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , ciphering is applied in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  for services delivered via the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 / _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , and by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  for services delivered via the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5.
17.873424530029297	The details of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  functionality are described in the  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0 , while additional  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  functionality, related to the interoperability with  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  systems is described in the  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1.
17.874046325683594	Example uses of the proprietary part of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  are included in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
17.874448776245117	In the second case, where the serving foreign operator has the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  only, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  client certificate is to be handed down in one direction only (see also  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0 on usage of client certificates).
17.87462615966797	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  interacts directly with the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  to perform authentication with  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 and establish a security association with this system directly.
17.874637603759766	When executing the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  for adding subsequent radio bearer(s) to the same  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  shall, for each new radio bearer, assign a radio bearer  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  that has not previously been used since the last  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4 change.
17.874919891357422	If the access token contains "additional scope" information (i.e. allowed resources and allowed  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 (service operations) on the resources), it checks that the additional scope matches the requested service operation.
17.875335693359375	If there is an available security context, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall integrity protect the Registration Request  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and shall send the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  instead of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
17.87567710876465	The reference point  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is used by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  to fetch the key material agreed during a previous protocol run over the reference point Ub from the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2.
17.876365661621094	If authentication of the ( _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ) _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  fails for any reason, the emergency call or  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 connection establishment for emergency session shall proceed as in 6.4.9.2 d) below.
17.877294540405273	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 is used to generate mobility keys.
17.8780517578125	In case  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  was included in the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  Request,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  will include the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  in the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1 Response.
17.878175735473633	First, if the absolute value of the difference between the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  and any currently active  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  is less than 4, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  value  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  be incremented by  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4 until the current condition is satisfied.
17.878881454467773	This could be configured in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  in the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 or the operator.
17.879127502441406	It is assumed in this clause that the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  is already registered over a first access type (say access  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0).
17.879213333129883	_Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  shows the dependencies between the different keys, and how they are derived from the network  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 point of view.
17.879741668701172	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 then selects the primary authentication method.

17.949357986450195	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  uses  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  authorization, the network shall use protection at the transport layer as described in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0.
17.94972038269043	This access control is completely local to the network of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 operator (i.e. home operator of subscriber).
17.949831008911133	If the term  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is used in this document without any further qualification then always  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  is meant, see  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0 of this specification.
17.950258255004883	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  payload is computed using the received  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.

17.95282745361328	The use of the 2<sup>32</sup>-1 as the value of the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  for the purpose of  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0   _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  calculation/verification does not actually set the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1 COUNT to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
17.95298194885254	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  Service Consumer shall request an access token from the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  in the same  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 using the Nnrf_AccessToken_Get request operation.
17.953140258789062	If a preferred  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0   _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  type was indicated and there are active  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  applications of this preferred type, then the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 function shall choose:
17.953454971313477	This completes the authentication  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  at the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
17.95346450805664	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  bit set to 1 indicates that the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  is   subscribed to receive ciphering keys applicable to corresponding positioning  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1   type.
17.95391273498535	More specifically, when an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  node modifies one or more attributes of the original  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and creates a modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect object to record its modifications, it shall use  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 to integrity protect the modifiedDataToIntegrityProtect object.
17.954051971435547	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  then transfers  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  (after flipping the least significant bit) to the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  and stores  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 , which is the concatenation of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4 , on the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5.
17.954355239868164	When the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  receives as authentication confirmation the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  Request  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  including a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 * it may verify whether the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1 has expired.

17.955965042114258	If such a collision occurs, then the key retrieved by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  can have a mismatch with the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  generated  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 key.
17.956951141357422	This  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is sent to an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , if the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  is used (e.g. the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  Server belongs to a third party), otherwise it may be sent directly to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4.
17.957660675048828	This feature is an optimization that might be useful, for example, when a  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  registers to different serving networks for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  access and untrusted  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  access (this is possible according to  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0).
17.9581241607666	In case failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or missing  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ) is detected after the start of integrity protection, the concerned  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 shall be discarded.

17.95907211303711	The details of the Serving  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  functionality are described in the  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0 , while additional Serving  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  functionality, related to the interoperability with  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  systems is described in the  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1.
17.960134506225586	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  Counter value '0' is used to calculate the first  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.

17.961626052856445	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  1: The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  server enhanced for  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  does not include any authentication vectors in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  to  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  HO request, since this could result in that authentication vectors intended for use only in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  domain would end up being used in a  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6 domain by accident.
17.961862564086914	The responding  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall compare the received security capabilities to its own supported security capabilities and selects, based on its local policy (e.g. based on whether there are  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  providers on the path between the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 ), a security mechanism, which is supported by both initiating  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  and responding  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4.
17.96187400817871	During mobility,  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  aspects that need to be considered are the possible  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  change, the possible  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1  algorithm change at  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  change, and the possible presence of a parallel  _Grammar_effigy/Message_2 connection.
17.96214485168457	Unlike the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 does not need to perform a fresh ephemeral key pair generation for each decryption.
17.962846755981445	The target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall create a  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  Container to signal the necessary security parameters to the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0.

17.963205337524414	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  does not find an  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  corresponding to the received  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  it shall return an appropriate error  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  to the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0.
17.963245391845703	When the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  operating system detects one of the conditions above, it can shut down the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 to force key deletion.
17.96367645263672	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall handle the maximum value of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  or  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  as described in section 6.4.3 with the exception that the maximum value of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  or  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  is stored on the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  rather than on the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4.
17.96369743347168	The  $ _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0 stores the authentication result accordingly.
17.96371078491211	If the target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  supports the ciphering and integrity algorithms used with the last source cell and these algorithms are the chosen algorithms by the target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , the target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  shall derive new  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  keys ( _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  integrity key,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  encryption key and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6  keys) using the algorithms the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  used with the source cell and the received  _Grammar_effigy/Data_7*.
17.965791702270508	This prevents the security issue of using the same  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  COUNTs with the same  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1  keys, e.g. key stream  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , in the case a  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  moves back and forth between two AMFs and the same  _Grammar_effigy/Message_2  keys are  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1.
17.966306686401367	Whether the key  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is used by the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  is out of the scope of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.

18.366947174072266	The following requirements and principles are applicable to bootstrapping  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0:
18.36699867248535	For better readability, this case is separated out in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  (b) If  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  is void then we set  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 = 1.

18.36920738220215	Depending on an operator's security requirements, the operator can decide whether to have Xn or N2 handovers for a particular  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 / _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  according to the security characteristics of a particular  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 / _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
18.369749069213867	If the common  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  security context is taken into use for the first time (partial) over  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  access, then the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  value and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  value for the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  access needs to be set to zero by the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  before the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  is taking the  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1 security context into use over non 3GPP access.
18.369857788085938	So the target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 can only select NIA0 for integrity protection and NEA0 for confidential protection.

18.563432693481445	As the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  is connected to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 , the source  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  has a current  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  security context for the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1.
18.563753128051758	If the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  has registrated to the same  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  through  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  access, and if this is the first time that the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  receives  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1 ’s  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  signalling through  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  access, the value of corresponding  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  used for integrity verification is 0; else it can use the existing  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  specific  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6 for integrity verification.
18.563793182373047	If  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is triggered as a result of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  may determine, based on  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  Context in the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , that for some or all  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4 (s) subject to  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  has already been authenticated following a Registration  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6 on a first access.

18.566801071166992	If the target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  does not receive the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , it shall store locally the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  and { _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 ,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  pair received from the source  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  and then send the received { _Grammar_effigy/Data_6 ,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_7  pair to the target  _Grammar_effigy/Data_8 / _Grammar_effigy/Data_9  within the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_10.
18.56682014465332	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall provide the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  to the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2.
18.566919326782227	The rules for when the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  shall select  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  for  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  integrity protection, and when the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall accept a  _Grammar_effigy/Message_1  security mode command selecting NIA0 for  _Grammar_effigy/Message_2  integrity protection depends on whether the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  can be certain that no  _Grammar_effigy/Message_3 security context can be established.
18.567420959472656	In the key derivation of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  as specified in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  as specified in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1,

18.567663192749023	In case of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  connects to  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  via  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2 , comparing to  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0, the difference is:
18.567703247070312	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall read the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  calculation information from the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1 , including the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  Type, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4   _Grammar_effigy/Data_5 , the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6 Public Key and the list of protection scheme identifiers.
18.567790985107422	The  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall derive the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  keys and the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  keys based on the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  and the received  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  security algorithms identifiers selected by the target eNB as described in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_0  in  _Grammar_effigy/Loc_1.
18.56790542602539	_Grammar_effigy/Data_0  formal set of  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  that are adopted to ensure communication between two or more functions within the within the same layer of a hierarchy of functions (source:  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2   _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.112).
18.567920684814453	This principle applies to all full  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ' authentications, even if the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  sent  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  in  _Grammar_effigy/Message_0  protocol or if the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_1  sent  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  in the respose to the  _Grammar_effigy/Procedure_0  identity requests as described in  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  or if no  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  was sent because the network performed  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6.
18.56805419921875	If  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  integrity protection is not activated for DRBs, the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0  shall not integrity protect the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  of such  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  and shall not put  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  into  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5 packet.
18.568275451660156	Note that if this is more efficient,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0 ,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  could also be computed earlier at any time after receiving  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3.
18.568361282348633	The  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  allocation through  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  allows to bind the Home Address with the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  security association so that the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3  can only send Binding Updates for its own Home Address and not for other  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4's Home Addresses.
18.569381713867188	When new key  _Grammar_effigy/Data_0  is agreed over the  _Grammar_effigy/Data_1  reference point and new  _Grammar_effigy/Data_2  keys need to be derived for one  _Grammar_effigy/Data_3 , then both,  _Grammar_effigy/Data_4  and  _Grammar_effigy/Data_5  (if present), shall be updated for this  _Grammar_effigy/Data_6 , but other keys  _Grammar_effigy/Data_7  or  _Grammar_effigy/Data_8  relating to other NAF_Ids, which may be stored on the  _Grammar_effigy/Actor_0, shall not be affected.
